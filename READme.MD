Installation
To start off with to run this program you need to have python and flask installed.
To install python it will vary depending on what OS you are running, for me I use windows so I just went to the python website to install it at python.org.  
Then to install flask it needs to have python 3.6.5 or above to be installed first. If you are running on windows the python interpreter needs to be in the path.

To Run The Project
How I ran the program was by selecting Python: Select Interpreter and then selecting python venv which is the python environment. 
Then I used the debugger in VS code with python flask selected. It should then run and show a local host link

To Use The Website
The first page should be a submission page where you can enter your information such as the food name, your name, your email, and the image of the food.
After submitting the image it should redirect you to the display page with a comment section for you to comment on the images.
But if you don't want to submit anything you could click to the display page and it will display two random images from the database.
